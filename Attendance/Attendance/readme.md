#  Attendance taking app developed using java
_My friend and I developped this app in high school for our highschool teachers. As a result most of the documentations we used are out of date_
This app is designed for teachers living in developping counries that do not have access to the internet. 
A teacher would be able to store students names. Then a teacher can take attandance of the students with out the need for using a peper or pen.
Finally the app would be able to take this data and provide the teacher with an anlyzed data showing which student has missed class the most and many more.
